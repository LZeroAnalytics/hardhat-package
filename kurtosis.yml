  Hardhat
  =======
  This Kurtosis package creates a Node.js container with a Hardhat project for Ethereum smart contract development, testing, and deployment. It provides functions for running scripts, tasks, tests, and compilation.

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  - Hardhat project either from GitHub or a local directory
  - Node.js compatible environment
  - Smart contracts to compile, test, or deploy

  Configuration
  -------------
  To configure this package, you'll need to provide the following information:
  - `project_url`: URL or local path to the Hardhat project
  - `env_vars`: Environment variables to pass to the Hardhat container (optional)
  - `more_files`: Additional files to mount in the container (optional)
  
  After deployment, you can use the following functions:
  - `script(plan, script, network, return_keys, params)`: Runs a Hardhat script
  - `task(plan, task_name, network, params)`: Executes a Hardhat task
  - `test(plan, smart_contract, network)`: Runs Hardhat tests
  - `compile(plan)`: Compiles smart contracts
  - `verify(plan, contract_address, network, verification_url, constructor_args, contract_path)`: Verifies contract on blockscout
  - `configure_networks(plan, networks)`: Configures multiple networks for deployment
  - `interact(plan, contract_address, function_name, network, params, return_keys)`: Interacts with a deployed contract
  - `optimize_gas(plan, contract_path)`: Runs gas optimization tools on contracts
  - `track_deployment(plan, contract_name, contract_address, network, constructor_args, contract_path)`: Tracks a deployed contract
